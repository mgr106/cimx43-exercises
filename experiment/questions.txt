What were you trying to accomplish? What was the tutorial or inspiration you tried to work with?
There were a few things I wanted to try and accomplish. My main goal was to create a landing page for myself that had the potential to be a portfolio or something more. I wanted to try the text changer we saw in other people's landing papges, as well as basic css animation and anything else that caught my eye. For some reason, this creators website has been living rent free in my mind for the past few weeks so I got a lot of inspiration from the website. (https://cathrine.co/).  
What was the most frustrating part of working on this exercise? The most rewarding?
The most frustrating was either the javascript for the changing text because a lot of it was a lot more complicated and confusing than I expected. Even now, I am not hundred percent certain how everything works, which is why I did the other javascript element of my popup social tag because I can say for certain that I completely understand it. Another thing that weirdly frustrated me was adding a second page. For some reason, even after I linked the page, it kept popping up as an error when I used my nav bar, but eventually it got its act together and works. The most rewarding may have been the css animation. I kept having all these portfolio websites living rent free in my brain and I think at least half of them have some sort of animation or spinning element, and I wanted one for my own landing page. I don't think I used the right equation for getting it where it is, but it is where I want it.
Would you do this exercise again?
I would do this exercise again, I think maybe having a smaller pool of javascript would be nice because it is quite intimidating, but overall I enjoyed the project.  
What would you change if you had another week?
I would cont. my pages and most likely try to find out a way to get my spinning smile in the top right corner without the method I used. And totally make it @media friendly.
